            <p>1) The band was formed in 1980 as Gerneric Cigarettes by Chris Richards, Kevin Fox, Marc Sahrmann and Dan Patterson with Marc on drums and Dan doing vocals. Soon after forming Marc and Dan switched positions and shortened the name to Generics. There were a few line-up changes and even a split up in 1982. Marc and lead guitarist Chris were the only original members when they reformed in 1983. The new group featured Marylou Ambrigio (guitar), John Ondrasek (bass), Bill Wallace (drums), and Lisa Patterson (sax). On August 29, 1983 they recorded a 4 song E.P. titled Societal Hemhorrage and self-released it in 1984. The release was postponed when Marc broke his back in a car accident September of 1983. He remained on life support for nine months and passed away on June 3, 1984 about a month after his 19th birthday. A few live performances have been recorded for video release including Live In The Core volumes 1 & 2.</p>
            <p>The generics are the best (and only) all-male a cappella group at the University of Maryland. Founded in 1988, we are Maryland's oldest group and are looking forward to celebrating our 20th anniversary next spring at SPAMfest 2008! We perform at various venues on and around the College Park campus in addition to traveling throughout the vast national network of colleges and universities in search of quality a cappella and an overall good time. We would love to come sing for you or with you, and we'd also love if you'd come and sing with us! Our music is an always-exciting collection of rock, hip-hop, R&B, oldies, classics and the hits of the 80's, 90's, and TODAY!</p>
